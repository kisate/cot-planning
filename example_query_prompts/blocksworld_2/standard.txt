Here is an example problem:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, the hand is empty, Block B is on top of Block D, Block A is on the table, Block D is on the table and Block C is on the table.
My goal is to have that Block D is on top of Block B.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack Block B from on top of Block D
put down Block B
pick up Block D
stack Block D on top of Block B
[PLAN END]

Here is another example:

My goal is to have that Block C is on top of Block B and Block D is on top of Block C.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack Block B from on top of Block C
put down Block B
unstack Block C from on top of Block A
put down Block C
pick up Block C
stack Block C on top of Block B
