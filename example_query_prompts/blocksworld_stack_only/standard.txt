Here is an example problem:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table and the hand is empty.
My goal is to have that Block B is on top of Block A.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up Block B
stack Block B on top of Block A
[PLAN END]

Here is another example:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table, Block C is on the table and the hand is empty.
My goal is to have that Block A is on top of Block C and Block B is on top of Block A.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up Block A
stack Block A on top of Block C
pick up Block B
stack Block B on top of Block A
[PLAN END]
