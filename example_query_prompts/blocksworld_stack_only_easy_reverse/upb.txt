Here is an example problem:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table and the hand is empty.
My goal is to have that Block B is on top of Block A.

My plan is as follows:

[THOUGHTS]
1. I look at the goal and stack each tower I need, starting from the bottom.
My goal only mentions blocks B and A. I check each of the mentioned blocks in order to determine which of them are the bases of towers.

Block A needs to have Block B on top of it. I double check the goal: this is the only condition that must hold for block B. It does not need to be on top of any other block. Therefore, I can use it as the base of a tower.
Block B needs to be on top of Block A, so it can't be the base of a tower.

In summary, only Block A can be used as a base of a tower.

I build the tower that has Block A as a base. I don't need to move Block A, and I leave it be, as I know it is already placed correctly.
The block that goes on top of Block A is Block B. I pick up Block B. I stack it on top of Block A.
This satisfies the part of the goal that says that Block B is on top of Block A.
No block needs to be on top of Block D. Therefore this tower is complete.

There are no other blocks which can be used as a base of a tower, and all the blocks mentioned in the goal have been placed, so I am done constructing.

2. Now, I write down my plan in the required format:

[PLAN]
pick up Block B
stack Block B on top of Block A
[PLAN END]

Here is another example:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table, Block C is on the table and the hand is empty.
My goal is to have that Block A is on top of Block C and Block B is on top of Block A.

My plan is as follows:

[THOUGHTS]
1. I look at the goal and stack each tower I need, starting from the bottom.
My goal only mentions blocks A, B, and C. I am free to ignore all other blocks. I check each of the mentioned blocks in order to determine which of them are the bases of towers.

Block C needs Block A on top of it. I double check the goal: this is the only condition that must hold for block C. It does not need to be on top of any other block. Therefore, I can use it as the base of a tower.
Block A needs Block B on top of it. I double check the goal: this isn't the only condition that must hold for Block A, because Block A needs to be on top of Block C. Therefore Block A can't be the base of a tower.
Block B needs to be on top of Block A, so it can't be the base of a tower.

In summary, only Block C can be used as the base of a tower.

I build the tower that has Block C as a base. I don't need to move Block C, and I leave it be, as I know it is already placed correctly.
The block that goes on top of Block C is Block A. I pick up Block A. I stack it on top of Block C.

[PLAN]

stack Block B on top of Block A
