Here is an example problem:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block B is on top of Block A, Block B is clear, Block A is on the table and the hand is empty.
My goal is to have that Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack Block B from on top of Block A
put down Block B
[PLAN END]

Here is another example:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block B is clear, Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on top of Block A, the hand is empty and Block C is on the table.
My goal is to have that Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table and Block C is on the table.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack Block B from on top of Block A
put down Block B
unstack Block A from on top of Block C
put down Block A
[PLAN END]
