Here is an example problem:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block B is on top of Block A, Block B is clear, Block A is on the table and the hand is empty.
My goal is to have that Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table.

My plan is as follows:

[THOUGHTS]
Any block arrangement problem of this type can be solved by putting every block on the table. I proceed with this algorithm. 
1. I take apart the tower, and put all the blocks on the table. 
Block B is clear.
Block B is on top of Block A, so I unstack it. Then, I put it down on the table.
Block A is already on the table, so the goal conditions are satisfied.

2. Now, I write down my plan in the required format:

[PLAN]
unstack Block B from on top of Block A
put down Block B
[PLAN END]

Here is another example:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block B is clear, Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on top of Block A, the hand is empty and Block C is on the table.
My goal is to have that Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table and Block C is on the table.

My plan is as follows:

[THOUGHTS]
Any block arrangement problem of this type can be solved by putting every block on the table. I proceed with this algorithm. 
1. I take apart the tower, and put all the blocks on the table. 
Block B is clear.
Block B is on top of Block A, so I unstack it. Then, I put it down on the table.
Now Block A is clear.
Block A is on top of Block C, so I unstack it. Then, I put it down on the table.
Block C is already on the table, so the goal conditions are satisfied.

2. Now, I write down my plan in the required format:

[PLAN]
unstack Block B from on top of Block A
put down Block B
unstack Block A from on top of Block C
put down Block A
[PLAN END]
