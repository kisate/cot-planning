Here is an example problem:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, the hand is empty, Block C is on top of Block A, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table.
My goal is to have that Block A is on top of Block C and Block B is on top of Block A

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack Block C from on top of Block A
put down Block C
pick up Block A
stack Block A on top of Block C
pick up Block B
stack Block B on top of Block A
[PLAN END]

Here is another example:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block B is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on top of Block D, Block B is on top of Block C, Block C is on top of Block A and Block D is on the table.
My goal is to have that Block C is on top of Block D, Block A is on top of Block C and Block B is on top of Block A.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack Block B from on top of Block C
put down Block B
unstack Block C from on top of Block A
put down Block C
unstack Block A from on top of Block D
put down Block A
pick up Block C
stack Block C on top of Block D
pick up Block A
stack Block A on top of Block C
pick up Block B
stack Block B on top of Block A
[PLAN END]
