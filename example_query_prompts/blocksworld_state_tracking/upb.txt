Here is an example problem:

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, the hand is empty, Block C is on top of Block A, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table.
My goal is to have that Block A is on top of Block C and Block B is on top of Block A

My plan is as follows:

2. Current State: Block A is clear, Block B is clear, the hand is currently holding Block C, Block A is on the table and Block B is on the table
   Action: put down the Block C
   Reason: The above action is applicable in the current state because its preconditions; the hand is currently holding Block C, are satisfied in the current state.
   Resulting State: Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table and Block C is on the table

3. Current State: Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table and Block C is on the table

4. Current State: Block B is clear, Block C is clear, the hand is currently holding Block A, Block B is on the table and Block C is on the table
   Action: stack the Block A on top of the Block C
   Reason: The above action is applicable in the current state because its preconditions; Block C is clear and the hand is currently holding Block A, are satisfied in the current state.
   Resulting State: Block A is clear, Block B is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on the table and Block C is on the table

5. Current State: Block A is clear, Block B is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on the table and Block C is on the table
   Action: pick up the Block B
   Reason: The above action is applicable in the current state because its preconditions; Block B is clear, the hand is empty and Block B is on the table, are satisfied in the current state.
   Resulting State: Block A is clear, the hand is currently holding Block B, Block A is on top of Block C and Block C is on the table

6. Current State: Block A is clear, the hand is currently holding Block B, Block A is on top of Block C and Block C is on the table
   Action: stack the Block B on top of the Block A
   Reason: The above action is applicable in the current state because its preconditions; Block A is clear and the hand is currently holding Block B, are satisfied in the current state.
   Resulting State: Block B is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on top of Block A and Block C is on the table

Final State: Block B is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on top of Block A and Block C is on the table
The goal conditions are satisfied in the final state. Hence, the above plan is valid.
