We start by unstacking blocks that are clear and work our way down.\n\n1. **Unstack Block H from on top of Block E** (Block H is clear)\n   - Put down Block H\n2. **Unstack Block L from on top of Block G** (Block L is clear)\n   - Put down Block L\n3. **Unstack Block N from on top of Block J** (Block N is clear)\n   - Put down Block N\n4. **Unstack Block G from on top of Block I** (Block G is clear)\n   - Put down Block G\n5. **Unstack Block K from on top of Block F** (Block K is clear)\n   - Put down Block K\n6. **Unstack Block F from on top of Block M** (Block F is clear)\n   - Put down Block F\n7. **Unstack Block M from on top of Block B** (Block M is clear)\n   - Put down Block M\n8. **Unstack Block B from on top of Block A** (Block B is clear)\n   - Put down Block B\n9. **Unstack Block E from on top of Block O** (Block E is clear)\n   - Put down Block E\n10. **Unstack Block D from on top of Block K** (Block D is clear)\n    - Put down Block D\n\n### Step 2: Construct New Stacks According to Goal\nNow, we will construct the stacks as per the goal conditions, starting from the base upwards.\n\n1. **Stack Block J on top of Block L**\n   - Pick up Block J\n   - Stack it on Block L\n2. **Stack Block A on top of Block J**\n   - Pick up Block A\n   - Stack it on Block J\n3. **Stack Block L on top of Block B**\n   - Pick up Block L\n   - Stack it on Block B\n4. **Stack Block N on top of Block D**\n   - Pick up Block N\n   - Stack it on Block D\n5. **Stack Block B on top of Block N**\n   - Pick up Block B\n   - Stack it on Block N\n6. **Stack Block I on top of Block K**\n   - Pick up Block I\n   - Stack it on Block K\n7. **Stack Block E on top of Block I**\n   - Pick up Block E\n   - Stack it on Block I\n8. **Stack Block H on top of Block O**\n   - Pick up Block H\n   - Stack it on Block O\n9. **Stack Block F on top of Block H**\n   - Pick up Block F\n   - Stack it on Block H\n10. **Stack Block K on top of Block F**\n    - Pick up Block K\n    - Stack it on Block F\n11. **Stack Block O on top of Block G**\n    - Pick up Block O\n    - Stack it on Block G\n12. **Stack Block G on top of Block M**\n    - Pick up Block G\n    - Stack it on Block M\n13. **Stack Block C on top of Block E**\n    - Pick up Block C\n    - Stack it on Block E\n14. **Stack Block D on top of Block C**\n    - Pick up Block D\n    - Stack it on Block C\n\n### Final Plan\nThe plan involves a series of unstacking and stacking actions, ensuring at each step that the block being moved is clear and the destination block is also clear.

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n### Step 1: Disassemble All Stacks\nFirst, we need to unstack all blocks that are not clear and place them on the table, ensuring that each block becomes clear and accessible.\n\n1. Unstack Block P from on top of Block B and put down Block P.\n2. Unstack Block B from on top of Block K and put down Block B.\n3. Unstack Block K from on top of Block M and put down Block K.\n4. Unstack Block M from on top of Block A and put down Block M.\n5. Unstack Block A from on top of Block H and put down Block A.\n6. Unstack Block H from on top of Block C and put down Block H.\n7. Unstack Block I from on top of Block E and put down Block I.\n8. Unstack Block E from on top of Block P and put down Block E.\n9. Unstack Block G from on top of Block N and put down Block G.\n10. Unstack Block N from on top of Block J and put down Block N.\n11. Unstack Block J from on top of Block O and put down Block J.\n12. Unstack Block O from on top of Block A and put down Block O.\n13. Unstack Block L from on top of Block G and put down Block L.\n14. Unstack Block F from on top of Block L and put down Block F.\n15. Unstack Block D from on top of Block I and put down Block D.\n\n### Step 2: Reassemble According to Goal\nNow, we will stack the blocks as per the goal configuration:\n\n1. Pick up Block C and stack it on top of Block P.\n2. Pick up Block H and stack it on top of Block C.\n3. Pick up Block D and stack it on top of Block F.\n4. Pick up Block I and stack it on top of Block D.\n5. Pick up Block K and stack it on top of Block I.\n6. Pick up Block E and stack it on top of Block K.\n7. Pick up Block G and stack it on top of Block E.\n8. Pick up Block P and stack it on top of Block G.\n9. Pick up Block F and stack it on top of Block M.\n10. Pick up Block M and stack it on top of Block A.\n11. Pick up Block A and stack it on top of Block B.\n12. Pick up Block B and stack it on top of Block N.\n13. Pick up Block N and stack it on top of Block L.\n14. Pick up Block L and stack it on top of Block O.\n15. Pick up Block O and stack it on top of Block J.\n\n### Final Check\nEnsure all blocks are stacked correctly according to the goal and no blocks are left unattended or misplaced. This completes the reconfiguration of the blocks as per the desired goal.",

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n### Step 1: Disassemble All Stacks\nFirst, we need to clear all blocks by unstacking them in a way that ensures each block ends up clear on the table. We start with the topmost clear blocks and work our way down:\n\n1. Unstack Block A from on top of Block F.\n2. Put down Block A.\n3. Unstack Block C from on top of Block B.\n4. Put down Block C.\n5. Unstack Block E from on top of Block K.\n6. Put down Block E.\n7. Unstack Block N from on top of Block E.\n8. Put down Block N.\n9. Unstack Block R from on top of Block N.\n10. Put down Block R.\n11. Unstack Block P from on top of Block R.\n12. Put down Block P.\n13. Unstack Block O from on top of Block G.\n14. Put down Block O.\n15. Unstack Block G from on top of Block J.\n16. Put down Block G.\n17. Unstack Block K from on top of Block C.\n18. Put down Block K.\n19. Unstack Block F from on top of Block M.\n20. Put down Block F.\n21. Unstack Block M from on top of Block H.\n22. Put down Block M.\n23. Unstack Block H from on top of Block Q.\n24. Put down Block H.\n\n### Step 2: Reassemble According to Goal\nNow, we will stack the blocks as per the goal configuration, starting from the base of each stack:\n\n1. Pick up Block R.\n2. Stack Block R on top of Block B.\n3. Pick up Block Q.\n4. Stack Block Q on top of Block R.\n5. Pick up Block K.\n6. Stack Block K on top of Block Q.\n7. Pick up Block G.\n8. Stack Block G on top of Block K.\n9. Pick up Block P.\n10. Stack Block P on top of Block G.\n11. Pick up Block A.\n12. Stack Block A on top of Block P.\n13. Pick up Block D.\n14. Stack Block D on top of Block A.\n15. Pick up Block J.\n16. Stack Block J on top of Block D.\n17. Pick up Block H.\n18. Stack Block H on top of Block J.\n19. Pick up Block M.\n20. Stack Block M on top of Block H.\n21. Pick up Block I.\n22. Stack Block I on top of Block M.\n23. Pick up Block B.\n24. Stack Block B on top of Block I.\n25. Pick up Block L.\n26. Stack Block L on top of Block B.\n27. Pick up Block F.\n28. Stack Block F on top of Block L.\n29. Pick up Block C.\n30. Stack Block C on top of Block F.\n31. Pick up Block O.\n32. Stack Block O on top of Block C.\n33. Pick up Block E.\n34. Stack Block E on top of Block O.\n35. Pick up Block N.\n36. Stack Block N on top of Block E.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis plan ensures that all blocks are stacked according to the goal configuration, with each action adhering to the rules of only moving clear blocks, ensuring the hand is empty before picking up a new block, and stacking only on clear blocks.",
