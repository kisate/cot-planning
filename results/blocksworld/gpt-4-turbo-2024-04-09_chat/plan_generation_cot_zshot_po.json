A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\nHere is the problem to solve:\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that: Block F is clear, Block J is clear, Block L is clear, Block P is clear, Block R is clear, Block S is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on top of Block I, Block B is on top of Block D, Block D is on top of Block E, Block E is on top of Block G, Block G is on top of Block H, Block J is on top of Block K, Block L is on top of Block N, Block M is on top of Block Q, Block O is on top of Block M, Block P is on top of Block C, Block Q is on top of Block A, Block R is on top of Block T, Block S is on top of Block O, Block T is on top of Block B, Block C is on the table, Block F is on the table, Block H is on the table, Block I is on the table, Block K is on the table and Block N is on the table.\nMy goal is for the following to be true: Block A is on top of Block G, Block B is on top of Block C, Block C is on top of Block R, Block D is on top of Block Q, Block E is on top of Block K, Block F is on top of Block E, Block G is on top of Block P, Block H is on top of Block J, Block I is on top of Block A, Block J is on top of Block O, Block K is on top of Block T, Block L is on top of Block D, Block M is on top of Block I, Block O is on top of Block F, Block P is on top of Block H, Block Q is on top of Block B, Block R is on top of Block M, Block S is on top of Block L and Block T is on top of Block N.\n\nWhat is the plan to achieve my goal?
