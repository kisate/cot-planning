Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Unstack Block D from on top of Block A**  \n   - Since Block D is clear and on top of Block A, and your hand is empty, you can unstack Block D.\n   - Action: unstack Block D from on top of Block A\n\n2. **Put down Block D**  \n   - Now holding Block D, you need to put it down to free your hand.\n   - Action: put down Block D\n\n3. **Unstack Block A from on top of Block E**  \n   - Block A is now clear since Block D was removed, and it is on top of Block E.\n   - Action: unstack Block A from on top of Block E\n\n4. **Put down Block A**  \n   - Holding Block A, put it down to free your hand.\n   - Action: put down Block A\n\n5. **Pick up Block D**  \n   - Block D is clear and on the table.\n   - Action: pick up Block D\n\n6. **Stack Block D on top of Block E**  \n   - Block E is clear and on the table.\n   - Action: stack Block D on top of Block E\n\n7. **Pick up Block A**  \n   - Block A is clear and on the table.\n   - Action: pick up Block A\n\n8. **Stack Block A on top of Block C**  \n   - Block C is clear and on the table.\n   - Action: stack Block A on top of Block C\n\n9. **Pick up Block B**  \n   - Block B is clear and on the table.\n   - Action: pick up Block B\n\n10. **Stack Block B on top of Block D**  \n    - Block D is now clear since it is on top of Block E and has nothing on it.\n    - Action: stack Block B on top of Block D\n\nThis plan rearranges the blocks to meet the goal conditions: Block A is on top of Block C, Block B is on top of Block D, Block D is on top of Block E, and Block E is on the table. Each action adheres to the restrictions of only handling one block at a time, ensuring the block is clear before picking it up or unstacking, and having an empty hand before picking up or unstacking a block.",
