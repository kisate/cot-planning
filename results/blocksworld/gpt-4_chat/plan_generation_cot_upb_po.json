            "query": "I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\nHere is an example problem:\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, the hand is empty, Block C is on top of Block A, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that Block A is on top of Block C and Block B is on top of Block A\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[THOUGHTS]\n1. I take apart all the towers, and put all the blocks on the table.\nI will check every block. Any that are already on the table can be left there. Any that are on top of another block must be put on the table, but I can only unstack them if they are clear, so I will check that before trying to unstack any of them. If a block needs to be moved but isn't clear, I'll come back to it later once it is. \n\nBlock A is already on the table but is not clear.\nBlock B is already on the table.\nBlock C is on top of Block A. I can only unstack a block that is clear. C is clear according to the initial condition, so I can proceed. I unstack it. Then, I put it down on the table. This clears Block A.\n\nAll the blocks are now clear and on the table.\n\n2. I look at the goal and stack each tower I need, starting from the bottom. I check each of the mentioned blocks in order to determine which of them are the bases of towers.\n\nBlock A needs to be on top of Block C, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock B needs to be on top of Block A, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock C needs Block A on top of it. I double check the goal: this is the only condition that must hold for block C. It does not need to be on top of any other block. Therefore, I can use it as the base of a tower.\n\nIn summary, only Block C can be used as a base of a tower.\n\nI build the tower that has Block C as a base. I don't need to move Block C, and I leave it be, as I know it is already placed correctly.\nThe block that goes on top of Block C is Block A. I pick up Block A. I stack it on top of Block C.\nThe block that goes on top of Block A is Block B. I pick up Block B. I stack it on top of Block A. \nNo block needs to be on top of Block B. Therefore this tower is complete.\n\nThere are no other blocks which can be used as a base of a tower, and all the blocks mentioned in the goal have been placed, so I am done constructing.\n\n3.

I check each of the mentioned blocks in order to determine which of them are the bases of towers.\n\nBlock A needs to be on top of Block Q, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock B needs to be on top of Block R, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock C needs to be on top of Block B, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock D needs to be on top of Block P, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock E needs to be on top of Block J, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock F needs to be on top of Block D, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock G needs to be on top of Block C, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock H needs to be on top of Block M, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock I needs to be on top of Block O, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock J needs to be on top of Block N, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock K needs to be on top of Block H, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock M needs to be on top of Block L, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock N needs to be on top of Block A, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock O needs to be on top of Block K, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock P needs to be on top of Block G, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock Q needs to be on top of Block F, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock R needs to be on top of Block I, so it can't be the base of a tower.\n\nIn summary, none of the blocks can be used as a base of a tower. This means that the blocks that are already on the table (A, D, F, Q) will be the bases of the towers.\n\nI build the towers that have Blocks A, D, F, Q as bases. \n\nThe block that goes on top of Block A is Block N.

I pick up Block J. I stack it on top of Block N.\nThe block that goes on top of Block J is Block E. I pick up Block E. I stack it on top of Block J.\nThe block that goes on top of Block E is Block N.

I check each of the mentioned blocks in order to determine which of them are the bases of towers.\n\nBlock C needs to be on top of Block D, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock A needs to be on top of Block C, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock B needs to be on top of Block A, so it can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock D needs Block C on top of it. I double check the goal: this is the only condition that must hold for block D. It does not need to be on top of any other block. Therefore, I can use it as the base of a tower.\n\nIn summary, only Block D can be used as the base of a tower.\n\nI build the tower that has Block D as a base. I don't need to move Block D, and I leave it be, as I know it is already placed correctly.\nThe block that goes on top of Block D is Block C. I pick up Block C. I stack it on top of Block D.\nThe block that goes on top of Block C is Block A. I pick up Block A. I stack it on top of Block C.\nThe block that goes on top of Block A is Block B. I pick up Block B. I stack it on top of Block A.\nNo block needs to be on top of Block B. Therefore this tower is complete.\n\nThere are no other blocks which can be used as a base of a tower, and all the blocks mentioned in the goal have been placed, so I am done constructing.\n\n3.

I take apart all the towers, and put all the blocks on the table.\nI will check every block. Any that are already on the table can be left there.

Therefore, I can use it as the base of a tower.\n\nIn summary, only Block D can be used as the base of a tower.\n\nI build the tower that has Block D as a base.
