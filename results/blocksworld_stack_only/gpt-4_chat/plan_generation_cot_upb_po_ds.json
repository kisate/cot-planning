But Block G is already at the base of the other tower, so I can't move it. Therefore this tower is incomplete.\n\nI realize that I have made a mistake. Block G can't be the base of a tower, because it needs to be on top of Block B. I need to revise my plan.\n\nI start over.

Therefore Block A can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock B needs to be on top of Block A, so it can't be the base of a tower.\n\nIn summary, only Block C can be used as the base of a tower.\n\nI build the tower that has Block C as a base. I don't need to move Block C, and I leave it be, as I know it is already placed correctly.\nThe block that goes on top of Block C is Block A. I pick up Block A. I stack it on top of Block C.\nThis satisfies the part of the goal that says that Block A is on top of Block C.\nThe block that goes on top of Block A is Block B. I pick up Block B. I stack it on top of Block A.\nThis satisfies the part of the goal that says that Block B is on top of Block A.\nNo block needs to be on top of Block B. Therefore this tower is complete.\n\nThere are no other blocks which can be used as a base of a tower, and all the blocks mentioned in the goal have been placed, so I am done constructing.\n\n2.
