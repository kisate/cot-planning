This setup forms a circular dependency where each block is simultaneously supporting and being supported by another, which violates the logical and physical constraints of stacking in a linear, non-circular manner. \n\nTo reiterate, it's impossible because:\n- If Block A is on top of Block B, Block B cannot support Block D (which needs to support Block A, forming a cycle).\n- A block cannot be both above and below another block simultaneously in a simple stacking scenario.\n\nPlease review the goal and check if there might have been an error in stating it or consider revising the goal to a feasible configuration.

However, this configuration creates a circular dependency where Block A is both supporting Block B and simultaneously supported by Block D, which forms a paradoxical loop making it impossible to achieve under normal circumstances with physical blocks. This is because if Block D is under Block A and Block A is on top of Block B, there cannot be a direct stacking of Block C on top of Block D without disrupting the earlier sequence. \n\nTherefore, the goal as stated is unachievable given the constraints of normal block stacking, where each block can only directly support the block directly above it and be supported by the block directly beneath it without forming loops or cycles. \n\nPlease revise the goal for a feasible configuration or consider different initial conditions or goals.",

Specifically, the goal requires Block D to be both directly under Block C and directly under Block A simultaneously, which contradicts the physical constraints of stacking.\n\nTo clarify, if Block D is directly under Block A, there is no way to stack Block C on top of Block D without removing Block A first, which would prevent Block A from being on top of Block B as planned. Similarly, if Block D is directly under Block C first, Block A cannot be placed on top of Block D without removing Block C.\n\nTherefore, the goal as stated is unachievable with the given constraints and actions permissible by the rules of the block stacking game.

Each block can only physically be in one position at a time, either on the table or on top of another block, but not both.\n\nTo achieve a goal in this block stacking context, the desired final configuration of blocks must be acyclic, meaning it should not contain any loops or cycles where a block is both supporting and supported by the same sequence of blocks.\n\nIf you have any other configuration or sequence in mind that avoids cyclic dependencies, I can help formulate a plan for that scenario."

The goal states that Block E must be on top of Block A, while also Block A needs to be on top of Block B. This creates a loop where Block A cannot both support Block E and be supported by Block B.\n\nTo clarify, if Block A is on top of Block B, and Block E is supposed to be on top of Block A, then placing Block D and Block C as required (Block C on top of Block D, and Block D on top of Block E) would mean lifting Block E (which supports Block D, which supports Block C) on top of Block A, which is not possible as Block A is already supporting Block B.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement as stated cannot be achieved with the set rules of block stacking, as it would require breaking the fundamental rule of not being able to place a block that is part of a stack on top of another block in the middle of another stack.\n\nTo achieve a similar but feasible configuration, we could create two separate stacks, or revise the goal such that no circular dependencies exist. Here's a suggestion for a revised goal:\n\nRevised Goal: \n- Block A on top of Block B\n- Block C on top of Block D\n- Block D on top of Block E\n\nIf this revised goal is acceptable, here is the plan:\n\n[PLAN]\n1. pick up Block D\n2. stack Block D on top of Block E\n3. pick up Block C\n4. stack Block C on top of Block D\n5. pick up Block A\n6. stack Block A on top of Block B\n[PLAN END]\n\nThis plan will result in two separate stacks with no circular dependencies:\n- One stack with Block A on top of Block B.\n- Another stack with Block C on top of Block D, which is on top of Block E.",

The desired configuration where Block A is on top of Block B, Block C is on top of Block D, Block D is on top of Block E, and Block E is on top of Block A forms a circular reference, which is physically impossible to achieve with standard stacking rules, as no block can be simultaneously above and below another block in a direct or indirect manner.\n\nGiven this, the goal as stated cannot be achieved.

Here's a plan based on that feasible interpretation:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up Block E\nstack Block E on top of Block D\npick up Block C\nstack Block C on top of Block E\npick up Block A\nstack Block A on top of Block B\n[PLAN END]\n\nThis plan will result in two stacks: C-D-E and A-B, which is a physically possible configuration to achieve with the given blocks and rules.",

Blocks inherently form a liner or tree-structured hierarchy, not a cyclic one.\n\nIf the goal has been misstated or misunderstood and there's a different configuration required (for example, a simple linear or hierarchical stack), please provide the correct goal for an appropriate plan.

Therefore, a valid plan cannot be formulated under the normal constraints and actions as described.\n\nIf the goal or the setup was misunderstood or needs adjustment, please clarify or modify the requirements for an achievable outcome.

If there is a mistake in the description of the goal or if a non-circular, feasible stacking order is provided, I could certainly help plan out the steps to achieve that configuration."

Since the blocks are all initially on the table and clear, and each block needs to end up on top of another, the stacking order and which block to pick up first matters significantly. We need to start by stacking blocks that will be on the bottom layer and work upward, ensuring that each block is clear when needed. Here's a suitable plan:\n\n[PLAN]\n1. pick up Block D\n2. stack Block D on top of Block H\n3. pick up Block G\n4. stack Block G on top of Block D\n5. pick up Block B\n6. stack Block B on top of Block G\n7. pick up Block E\n8. stack Block E on top of Block B\n9. pick up Block C\n10. stack Block C on top of Block E\n11. pick up Block F\n12. stack Block F on top of Block C\n13. pick up Block A\n14. stack Block A on top of Block F\n15. pick up Block I\n16. stack Block I on top of Block A\n[PLAN END]\n\nThis plan ensures that each block is picked up and stacked in a manner that adheres to the rules: a block can only be stacked if the hand is holding it and the target block is clear. Additionally, once a block is placed or stacked, the hand becomes empty again, ready for the next action. This sequence builds from the deepest level (Block H) upwards, layer by layer, until the final arrangement is achieved."
