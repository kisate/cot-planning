A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\nHere is the problem to solve:\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that: Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block C is clear, Block D is clear, Block E is clear, Block F is clear, Block G is clear, Block H is clear, Block I is clear, Block J is clear, Block K is clear, Block L is clear, Block M is clear, Block N is clear, Block O is clear, Block P is clear, Block Q is clear, Block R is clear, Block S is clear, Block T is clear, the hand is empty, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table, Block C is on the table, Block D is on the table, Block E is on the table, Block F is on the table, Block G is on the table, Block H is on the table, Block I is on the table, Block J is on the table, Block K is on the table, Block L is on the table, Block M is on the table, Block N is on the table, Block O is on the table, Block P is on the table, Block Q is on the table, Block R is on the table, Block S is on the table and Block T is on the table.\nMy goal is for the following to be true: Block A is on top of Block E, Block C is on top of Block S, Block D is on top of Block J, Block E is on top of Block I, Block F is on top of Block K, Block G is on top of Block M, Block H is on top of Block N, Block I is on top of Block D, Block J is on top of Block G, Block K is on top of Block C, Block L is on top of Block Q, Block M is on top of Block B, Block N is on top of Block O, Block O is on top of Block L, Block P is on top of Block T, Block Q is on top of Block R, Block R is on top of Block F, Block S is on top of Block A and Block T is on top of Block H.\n\nWhat is the plan to achieve my goal?
