The goal specifies a series of blocks that need to be stacked on top of each other in a specific order.\n\n2.

This indicates a circular dependency, which is typically not possible in a stacking problem unless there is an error in the problem statement or goal.\n\n3. Assuming the goal is to create a series of stacks that are interdependent, I will need to break down the dependencies to find a starting point. Let's analyze the dependencies:\n   - Block A depends on Block H, which depends on Block K, which depends on Block B, which depends on Block J.\n   - This forms a circular dependency involving A, H, K, B, and J.\n\n   Similarly, other blocks form interdependencies:\n   - Block C depends on Block L, which depends on Block D, which depends on Block I, which depends on Block F, which depends on Block M, which depends on Block A.\n   - This forms another circular dependency involving C, L, D, I, F, M, and A.\n\n4. Given the circular dependencies, it is impossible to start stacking as no block can be placed first without violating the conditions that a block must be clear to be picked up or stacked upon.\n\n[PLAN]\nDue to the circular dependencies in the goal, it is not possible to achieve the desired configuration with the given constraints and actions. The problem might require revisiting the goal or the initial conditions to ensure that there is at least one block that can act as a base to start the stacking process.",

First, I identify which blocks can be the base of a tower:\n   - Block H is not mentioned as needing to be on top of any other block, so it can be a base.\n   - Block O is on top of Block H, so Block O cannot be a base.\n   - Block D is on top of Block O, so Block D cannot be a base.\n   - Block L is on top of Block D, so Block L cannot be a base.\n   - Block C is on top of Block L, so Block C cannot be a base.\n   - Block F is on top of Block C, so Block F cannot be a base.\n   - Block M is on top of Block F, so Block M cannot be a base.\n   - Block E is on top of Block M, so Block E cannot be a base.\n   - Block B is on top of Block E, so Block B cannot be a base.\n   - Block K is on top of Block B, so Block K cannot be a base.\n   - Block I is on top of Block K, so Block I cannot be a base.\n   - Block G is on top of Block I, so Block G cannot be a base.\n   - Block N is on top of Block G, so Block N cannot be a base.\n   - Block J is on top of Block N, so Block J cannot be a base.\n   - Block A is on top of Block J, so Block A cannot be a base.\n\n3. From the analysis, Block H is the only block that can be the base. I will now plan the stacking order based on the dependencies:\n   - Start with Block H on the table.\n   - Stack Block O on Block H.\n   - Stack Block D on Block O.\n   - Stack Block L on Block D.\n   - Stack Block C on Block L.\n   - Stack Block F on Block C.\n   - Stack Block M on Block F.\n   - Stack Block E on Block M.\n   - Stack Block B on Block E.\n   - Stack Block K on Block B.\n   - Stack Block I on Block K.\n   - Stack Block G on Block I.\n   - Stack Block N on Block G.\n   - Stack Block J on Block N.\n   - Finally, stack Block A on Block J.\n\n4.

I will now plan the stacking sequence, ensuring that each block is placed on its respective base without violating any conditions:\n\n[PLAN]\n- pick up Block G\n- stack Block G on top of Block B\n- pick up Block E\n- stack Block E on top of Block C\n- pick up Block N\n- stack Block N on top of Block E\n- pick up Block Q\n- stack Block Q on top of Block H\n- pick up Block B\n- stack Block B on top of Block G\n- pick up Block I\n- stack Block I on top of Block F\n- pick up Block O\n- stack Block O on top of Block I\n- pick up Block D\n- stack Block D on top of Block L\n- pick up Block L\n- stack Block L on top of Block A\n- pick up Block A\n- stack Block A on top of Block J\n- pick up Block J\n- stack Block J on top of Block P\n- pick up Block P\n- stack Block P on top of Block K\n- pick up Block K\n- stack Block K on top of Block C\n- pick up Block C\n- stack Block C on top of Block E\n- pick up Block F\n- stack Block F on top of Block I\n- pick up Block M\n- stack Block M on top of Block F\n- pick up Block H\n- stack Block H on top of Block Q\n- pick up Block N\n- stack Block N on top of Block H\n\n[PLAN END]\n\nThis plan ensures that each block is stacked according to the goal, with careful sequencing to avoid any block being moved before its base is ready.",

Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\nHere is an example problem:\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, Block A is clear, Block B is clear, Block A is on the table, Block B is on the table and the hand is empty.\nMy goal is to have that Block B is on top of Block A.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[THOUGHTS]\n1. I look at the goal and stack each tower I need, starting from the bottom.\nMy goal only mentions blocks B and A. I check each of the mentioned blocks in order to determine which of them are the bases of towers.\n\nBlock A needs to have Block B on top of it. I double check the goal: this is the only condition that must hold for block A. It does not need to be on top of any other block. Therefore, I can use it as the base of a tower.\nBlock B needs to be on top of Block A, so it can't be the base of a tower.\n\nIn summary, only Block A can be used as a base of a tower.\n\nI build the tower that has Block A as a base. I don't need to move Block A, and I leave it be, as I know it is already placed correctly.\nThe block that goes on top of Block A is Block B. I pick up Block B. I stack it on top of Block A.\nThis satisfies the part of the goal that says that Block B is on top of Block A.\nNo block needs to be on top of Block B. Therefore this tower is complete.\n\nThere are no other blocks which can be used as a base of a tower, and all the blocks mentioned in the goal have been placed, so I am done constructing.\n\n2.

Therefore, I can use it as the base of a tower.\nBlock A needs Block B on top of it. I double check the goal: this isn't the only condition that must hold for Block A, because Block A needs to be on top of Block C. Therefore Block A can't be the base of a tower.\nBlock B needs to be on top of Block A, so it can't be the base of a tower.\n\nIn summary, only Block C can be used as the base of a tower.\n\nI build the tower that has Block C as a base.
