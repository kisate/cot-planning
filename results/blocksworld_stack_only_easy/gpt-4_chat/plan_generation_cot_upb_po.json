Now, I write down my plan in the required format:\n\n[PLAN]\npick up Block S\nstack Block S on top of Block T\npick up Block R\nstack Block R on top of Block S\npick up Block Q\nstack Block Q on top of Block R\npick up Block P\nstack Block P on top of Block Q\npick up Block O\nstack Block O on top of Block P\npick up Block N\nstack Block N on top of Block O\npick up Block M\nstack Block M on top of Block N\npick up Block L\nstack Block L on top of Block M\npick up Block K\nstack Block K on top of Block L\npick up Block J\nstack Block J on top of Block K\npick up Block I\nstack Block I on top of Block J\npick up Block H\nstack Block H on top of Block I\npick up Block G\nstack Block G on top of Block H\npick up Block F\nstack Block F on top of Block G\npick up Block E\nstack Block E on top of Block F\npick up Block D\nstack Block D on top of Block E\npick up Block C\nstack Block C on top of Block D\npick up Block B\nstack Block B on top of Block C\npick up Block A\nstack Block A on top of Block B\n[PLAN END]",
